# HoruCNC
HoruCNC instantly converts photographs and images into toolpaths that can be run on virtually all CNC routing and engraving machines.

Computer-controlled cutters of wood, metal and other materials can translate a design into a prototype in short order, making the process of iterating a project much easier. However, the software to create these designs can be expensive and complex.
